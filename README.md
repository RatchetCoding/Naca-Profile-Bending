NACA Profile Bending

This is a simple program to do some geometry tasks. It bends an existing Naca profile along an arc. First it determines the arc from the given data and then moves the old points of the profile to their new position.

I created this for a college project and I am now publishing it hoping for some constructive criticism. My biggest concern is the file reading, I'm looking for a more effective and clean way to do it.
